Sets :
ğŸ‘‰ unordered collection of data.
ğŸ‘‰ unlike in the list, tuple, or dictionaries all the items are in ordered and have a indexes.
ğŸ‘‰ while in the sets there is no order in sets.
ğŸ‘‰ when we print any value it will print the value in diff order.
ğŸ‘‰ sets are written in {}
ğŸ‘‰ they are mutable we can change the values, like delete, add , remove etc.
ğŸ‘‰ values are separated by ,
ğŸ‘‰ all the values will be unique. like if we have same value more than once then
    it will not be printed.
