"""
in numpy on all the data we used scientific method
so if we want to manipulate data in more structured way...
like Excel sheet we can use pandas.

Pandas = python data analysis.

we can easily handle missing data by pandas.
we can insert new columns rows easily etc.
can create rows, columns etc.
powerful method like in Excel we use group by etc. functions
we can group all the data etc. easily.
and many more.

just like numpy pandas also has its own data structure.

SERIES : if we have only one single column it's called series
DATAFRAMES : if we have multiple columns and rows it's called dataframes.

we can apply same all functions of data frames on series.

we can call series as a 1D array because it has only one column.

it has its indexes.

dataframes is 2D => it has multiple rows and columns



there are multiple forms in which we can insert data in dataframes.
like we can import data from csv files, we can import from any sql or Excel sheet
or we can also give data manually in rows and columns by ourselves.
