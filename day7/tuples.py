"""
Tuples : tuples are ordered and un-mutable data.
tuples cannot be add or remove.
for creating tuples bracket are not necessary. but you can use ()
all the values are separated by comma(,)
multiple data types can be written in tuple.
if we write only one value inside tuple then it will show us like string
so if we want to create a tuple with only one value we have to use , after the first
value of the tuple. like given below.
"""


a = ("apple", "banana", "cat", "orange")
print(a)
print(type(a))

b = ("Hello",)
print(b)
print(type(b))
